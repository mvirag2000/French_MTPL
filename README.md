# French_MTPL
I did a case study on my blog, running Big Query ML against the French_MTPL insurance-claims dataset.  This repo contains code I wrote about in the post, and some that I didn't.  The post went over 1,200 words and had to be scaled back.  Anyway, help yourself to the code and if you need further explanation, read the blog.
One more thing: the blog text credits Lorentzen, et al. for the good Gini routine.
